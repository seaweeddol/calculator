## Bugs
- ~~Pressing operators consecutively returns 0, infinity, or NaN~~ 2/27/2019
- ~~Dividing by 0 returns infinity~~
- ~~If equation equals 0, the next number is added to the string '0', and then replaced by the next number~~
- ~~If last button pressed after dividing by zero was =, next number is saved to num2 var instead of result~~
- ~~If operator is pressed before any number is present, it performs the operation on 0~~ (not a bug)
- ~~If operator is not empty, and operator is pressed after equal sign, last value is used for operate()~~
- ~~If = is pressed between numbers and num2 is not empty, the number is appended to num2 variable~~
- ~~Backspace button runs into problems if pressed after an operator~~

## To-Do's
- Disallow multiple decimals in input
- Round decimals after certain amount of characters
- Add option to toggle sign from positive/negative
- Add keyboard support
